				<h2>About Our Sponsor and Affiliates</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 50px; font-weight: 700;">Axon Capital</p>
				<h4>Founded by Dinakar Singh, Axon Capital (‚ÄúAxon‚Äù) is a global investment firm focused on concentrated long-term investments in both public and private companies. Axon manages various funds with assets under management of approximately $500 million, of which Mr. Singh and/or related and controlled entities are the largest investor.</h4>
				<h4>Axon was founded by Mr. Singh in 2005, after 14 years at Goldman Sachs, where he helped build, and eventually was global co-head, of the firm‚Äôs highly profitable global equities proprietary trading and investing business. For much of its early years, Axon focused on a broad range of long and short investments, based on exhaustive bottoms-up fundamental research, across asset classes and across geographies, through investment teams and offices in Asia, Europe, and the US. In addition to equities and credit long and short investments, Axon also had a significant focus on private investments, and in particular was a pioneer in large scale investing in drug royalty investments. In addition, Axon selectively engaged in high-profile activist investments in industries including healthcare and energy.</h4>
				<h4>In recent years, Axon has focused on making concentrated long-term investments in both public and private companies. Within private investments, the focus has been on investments in early-stage growth companies which we believe have business models that are attractive and highly scalable, and where we believe we can enhance value through our involvement. Axon often takes hands-on, leadership positions in our growth investments, and we work closely with management teams to optimize strategy and execution. All investments are based on exhaustive analysis and extensive due diligence utilizing both the Axon team, as well as an extensive network of advisors, consultants, and relationships.</h4>
				<h4>Axon‚Äôs leadership is comprised of Mr. Singh, and Ms. Koryn Estrada, who together serve as co-CEO and co-CIO, and have worked together for over 10 years, along with their partner Alexander Blank.</h4>
